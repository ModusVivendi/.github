   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# For team members
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For external contributors (from your fork)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Adding tests

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, commented code
- Follow the existing code style
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write meaningful commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(autonomous): add AprilTag detection algorithm

- Implemented OpenCV-based AprilTag detection
- Added distance calculation from detected tags
- Updated autonomous navigation to use tag data
"
```

Commit message format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Push Your Changes

```bash
# For team members
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# For external contributors
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch
4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Testing performed
   - Related issues (if any)
5. Request review from team leaders

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Java (FTC Projects)

```java
// Use meaningful variable names
double targetDistance = 10.0; // Good
double d = 10.0; // Bad

// Add comments for complex logic
/**
 * Calculates the motor power needed to reach target position
 * using PID control algorithm.
 *
 * @param currentPosition Current encoder position
 * @param targetPosition Desired encoder position
 * @return Motor power value between -1.0 and 1.0
 */
public double calculateMotorPower(int currentPosition, int targetPosition) {
    // Implementation
}

// Use consistent formatting
if (condition) {
    doSomething();
} else {
    doSomethingElse();
}
```

### C++ (Arduino Projects)

```cpp
// Use meaningful names and comments
const int SENSOR_PIN = A0;  // Temperature sensor input
const int LED_PIN = 13;     // Status LED

void setup() {
    pinMode(SENSOR_PIN, INPUT);
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

// Document functions
/**
 * Reads temperature from sensor and returns value in Celsius
 */
float readTemperature() {
    int rawValue = analogRead(SENSOR_PIN);
    return (rawValue * 5.0 / 1024.0 - 0.5) * 100.0;
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Test Your Code**
   - Run all existing tests
   - Add new tests for new features
   - Test on actual robot hardware when possible

2. **Check for Issues**
   - No compilation errors
   - No runtime errors in testing
   - Code follows style guidelines

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README if needed
   - Add inline code comments
   - Update relevant docs/ files

## üêõ Reporting Bugs
